## Overview

This project is a React Native mobile application that implements a basic authentication flow controlling access to the rest of the app. The application simulates server authentication using a mock API response.

The architecture emphasizes clean separation of concerns. It uses context-based auth state management, reducers, and service layers. Persistent storage is used to maintain the session across app restarts, and the app checks token TTL (time-to-live) to determine whether the session is still valid.
When launched, the app does the following:


### Highlights
* Auth is implemented as a finite state machine.  The additional bootstrapping state prevents page flicker during app initialization.

* Authentication is controlled through a reducer-based state model.

* A storage abstraction layer isolates persistence from the UI and state logic.

* Stack rendering is handled using the Expo Router protected routes feature, which determines the appropriate stack view based on authentication state._
